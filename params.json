This allows to user to focus on using the generated corpus in a variety of _Natural Language Processing_ & _Machine Learning_ Tasks instead of crawling web pages.\r\n\r\n### How To Use\r\nTo install the module simple grab it from PyPi:\r\n\r\n`pip install news-corpus-builder`\r\n\r\nUsing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom news_corpus_builder import NewsCorpusGenerator\r\n\r\n# Location to save generated corpus\r\ncorpus_dir = '/Users/skillachie/finance_corpus'\r\n\r\n# Save results to sqlite or  files per article \r\nex = NewsCorpusGenerator(corpus_dir,'sqlite')\r\n\r\n# Retrieve 50 links related to the search term dogs and assign a category of Pet to the retrieved links\r\nlinks = ex.google_news_search('dogs','Pet',50)\r\n\r\n# Generate and save corpus\r\nex.generate_corpus(links)\r\n\r\n```\r\nPlease see [example.py](https://github.com/skillachie/news-corpus-builder/blob/master/example.py) that was used to generate a corpus with over 2500 articles across 11 finance topics.\r\n\r\n### Limitations \r\n* The module currently uses Google News as the source to obtain the links for the relevant articles.\r\n* Google News only returns a max of 100 articles per search term. To build a bigger corpus you can specify multiple related terms or run it again the following day to add the new articles to the previously generated corpus.\r\n* Can add additional sources\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to contribute or make suggestions, features requests.
